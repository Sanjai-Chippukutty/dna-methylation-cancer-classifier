# dna-methylation-cancer-classifier
This project builds a machine learning classifier using DNA methylation data to predict cancer subtypes. It processes beta values from 200 patient samples to train and evaluate classification models. The goal is to demonstrate the use of methylation biomarkers in early cancer detection.
